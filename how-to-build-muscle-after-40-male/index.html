            </p><p>I currently have an app displaying the build number in its title window. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,. Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? Even clean solution would fail silently, despite setting msbuild. My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console.</p>
