            </p><p>It is a compound adjective and needs to be hyphenated. Hyphenation helps distinguish between possible. I personally would have written it in exactly the same way. Hi everyone, it looks like most compound adjectives are always hyphened when they precede the noun that they modify (with some exceptions when the meaning is really. An idiom is a an expression that has a meaning different. It dries hard and has a strong bond. The takeaway was essentially that if you didn't know what other people were listening to, there was much more chaos in the list of the most popular music. A compound is anything consisting of two or more parts.</p>
