            </p><p>She'd come in my room and not really ask, she'd just get in my bed. What if i no one noticed i was missing until rounds? Some time in my sleep i woke up choking. A few days ago, i went over to my friends house. You could get tired from studying and hanging out in tartarus for too long, taking a shit or sleeping in class or. When she got out the shower, she went to the room she was sleeping in and changed however didn't close the door completely for whatever reason. In medical school i had this great fear that in residency, i‘d accidentally sleep in, which would be an absolute disaster. Light jolteon has a sleeping togepi if you wanna count that.</p>

        <p>When she got out the shower, she went to the room she was sleeping in and changed however didn't close the door completely for whatever reason.
