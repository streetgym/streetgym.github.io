            </p><p>Sleeping is the closest i can get to being dead without hurting my family reply reply. Some time in my sleep i woke up choking. We had some drinks and i stayed over at his place. I came to the conclusion that leaving it on stand by mode or sleep mode is probably better because the action of turning it off and then turning it on again causes more. In medical school i had this great fear that in residency, i‘d accidentally sleep in, which would be an absolute disaster. We have been friends for years. But my personal favorite is the dedenne with the cute zzz reverse pattern! Light jolteon has a sleeping togepi if you wanna count that.</p>
