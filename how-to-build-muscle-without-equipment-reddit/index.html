            </p><p>I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console. What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? I currently have an app displaying the build number in its title window. Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,. 4 i got this to work with the latest build_runner and json_serializable versions after a long process of trying all of the above suggestions:</p>

        <p>Even clean solution would fail silently, despite setting msbuild.
