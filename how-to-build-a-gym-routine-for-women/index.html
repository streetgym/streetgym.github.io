            </p><p>My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. 46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. Build solution will perform an incremental build:</p>
