            </p><p>The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console. What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? Because these components are the same as the ones. Build solution will perform an incremental build: If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,. Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build.</p>

        <p>46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. Even clean solution would fail silently, despite setting msbuild. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success.</p>
