            </p><p>Is considered as is an alternative way of saying the same thing. Does this as change the meaning or correctness of this sentence? I don't see any problem with your example about french as a language of love, although it would more. He could be considered (as) the standard of the average. 1 both “considered to be” and “considered as” are incorrect. I have the following idea: Adam is considered to be a good teacher. Literally, that the object is the subject.</p>

        <p>He should be considered our. The words “as” or “to be”, when used after the word “considered” are nearly always superfluous, and therefore unnecessary. Adam is considered to be a good teacher.</p>

        <p>Adam is considered as a good teacher. Those who are considered gorgeous / those who are considered as gorgeous people considered as is less common than considered to be and they may have different.

        <p>Is there any difference between considered to be and considered as? Literally, that the object is the subject. Considered + object used when the subject should be just another name for something.</p>

        <p>This is considered as socially desired. Are both of them grammatically correct? Red apples, considered in this work, are tasty vs red apples, which are considered in this work, are tasty. i learned english intuitively by watching movies, reading.</p>
