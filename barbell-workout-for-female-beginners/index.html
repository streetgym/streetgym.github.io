            </p><p>Barbel fishing website for all barbel anglers. Is an hour fishing at sunrise better than 6 during the day? Barbel river records in association with the barbel society. You need to be a registered member of barbel fishing world to post on these forums. Boilies play a big part in most of our barbel fishing now and with so many different. I tend to have my best results at sunrise/early morning and to be honest have come to the conclusion there is little. As far as i know there is no publication anymore. Just for a bit of fun, what's everyone's preferred boilie of choice.</p>
