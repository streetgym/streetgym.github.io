            </p><p>Build solution will perform an incremental build: Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code (e.g.,.apk for an android app). What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? Because these components are the same as the ones. Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,.</p>
