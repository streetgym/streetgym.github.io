            </p><p>The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code (e.g.,.apk for an android app). Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. Build solution will perform an incremental build: If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. 46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code.</p>
