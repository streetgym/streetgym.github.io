            </p><p>I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. Even clean solution would fail silently, despite setting msbuild. Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,. 46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need.</p>
