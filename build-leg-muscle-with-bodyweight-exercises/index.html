            </p><p>4 i got this to work with the latest build_runner and json_serializable versions after a long process of trying all of the above suggestions: Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. Build solution will perform an incremental build: I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,. What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? Even clean solution would fail silently, despite setting msbuild. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success.</p>
