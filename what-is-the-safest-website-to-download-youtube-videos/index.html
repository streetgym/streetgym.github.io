            </p><p>These sores can be caused by numerous things, including a sexually transmitted infection (sti), such as herpes simplex virus (hsv) or human papillomavirus (hpv). A bump on labia can be caused by ingrown hairs, bartholin cyst, genital herpes, genital warts, sebaceous cysts, varicose veins, or even vulvar cancer. Find out what you need to know about vulvar ulcers and discover the causes, treatments, and how they may affect health. The body responds by releasing special cells that worsen the irritation.
