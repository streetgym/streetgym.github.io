            </p><p>4 i got this to work with the latest build_runner and json_serializable versions after a long process of trying all of the above suggestions: I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,. Even clean solution would fail silently, despite setting msbuild. 46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm.</p>
